## Usage

This is a calendar for scheduling events throughout the day, and organizes the day by blocking the time by the hour, and color coding those blocks to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future. All the user has to do is type their tasks into the text container in the center of the time block, and click the save button on the right, and their tasks will be saved to local storage and appear upon page reload.
